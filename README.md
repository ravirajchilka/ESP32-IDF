# What's Embedded System ?
An embedded system is a small computer with sensors attached to it and it's designed to perform a specific task, either as a standalone device or as part of a larger system. Examples of embedded systems are Mobile phones, Digital cameras, TV remote control, GPS systems, Fitness trackers, Medical devices, Automotive systems, ATMs, Factory robots etc.
Embedded Systems design is an important skillset for Electronics Engineers. There are 2 ways to design and develop embedded systems one is by using small computers like microcontrollers or SBCs(Singl Board Computers) which generally requires knowledge of RTOS/Linux OS and C/C++. Another way of doing it by building entire hardware from scratch using CMOS logic gates which needs knowledge of Hardware Description Languges like VHDL, Verilog or SystemVerilog.
